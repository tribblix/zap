Managing SSL certificates
=========================

The central store of SSL CA certificates on Tribblix is located in
/etc/openssl, where clients can either load the store as a single file
(the cacert.pem file) or as a directory of certificates named by hash
(in /etc/openssl/certs).

If you need to manage additional CA certificate, use the command

    zap manage-cacerts [subcommand ...]

To add a certificate in a given file,

    zap manage-cacerts add /path/to/certificate.pem

To list all added certificates

    zap manage-cacerts list

To list all certificates, including the default certificates

    zap manage-cacerts listall

To remove a certificate that has previously been added,

    zap manage-cacerts remove certificate-name

The name to remove can be obtained from the list subcommand.
