ZAP
===

The zap utility is the primary administration tool for software and zones
on Tribblix.

The basic usage is:

zap subcommand [arguments ...]

The subcommands are:

refresh

  This subcommand refreshes the list of overlays, their contents, and
  the package catalog.

search [-R dir] search_term

  This subcommand searches for overlays and packages matching the given
  search term.

whatprovides search_term

  This subcommand searches for overlays and packages containing files
  matching the given search term.

retrieve pkg [pkg ...]

  This subcommand will retrieve the package(s) specified from a
  repository and save it or them to the local cache.

install [-R dir] [-s dir] pkg [pkg ...]

  This subcommand will install the package or packages specified. The
  -R flag allows you to specify an alternate root for installation, the
  -s flag allows you to specify a local directory containing packages
  (for example, the CD).

update [-R dir] pkg [pkg ...]

  This subcommand will update the given package(s) to the latest
  available version.

uninstall [-R dir] pkg [pkg ...]

  This subcommand will uninstall the given package(s).

list-packages [args]

  Simply lists the installed packages; this is an alias for the
  pkginfo utility.

describe-package pkg [pkg ...]

  Prints the output from pkginfo -l on the given package(s).

check-package pkg [pkg ...]

  Checks that the contents of an installed package are correct. This
  is essentially a wrapper round the pkgchk utility.

list-overlays [-R dir] [-i|-u] [-v]

  This subcommand lists the available overlays. With -i, just shows
  installed overlays. With -u, just shows uninstalled overlays.
  Without -i or -u, indicates whether the overlay is installed.
  With -v, also shows the short description of the overlay.

describe-overlay overlay [overlay ...]

  Prints a summary of the given overlay(s), showing long name, any
  dependencies, and whether the overlay is installed.

install-overlay [-R dir] [-s dir] overlay

  This subcommand will install the given overlay, and any overlays it
  depends upon.

update-overlay [-R dir] [-s dir] overlay | -a

  This subcommand will update all the packages in the given overlay to
  the current version. If -a, updates all installed overlays.

uninstall-overlay [-R dir] overlay

  This subcommand will uninstall the given overlay, and all the
  packages it contains that are not required by other overlays. If the
  overlay is required by another overlay, it is not uninstalled.

verify-overlay [-R dir] overlay | -a

  This subcommand checks that all the packages contained in the given
  installed overlay are in fact installed and are at the current
  version. If -a, verifies all installed overlays.

verify-packages [-R dir]

  This subcommand checks that all installed packages are at the current
  version.

ddu [-u] [-i]

  This subcommand will identify which drivers and packages are
  available for the hardware installed in the current system.

clean-cache -a | -i | -o | -u

  This subcommand will clean up the cached downloaded zap files. With
  -a, clean the entire cache. With -i, clean zap files corresponding
  to installed packages. With -o, clean up old zap files. With -u,
  clean up zap files for unrecognised packages.

set-hostname hostname | -d domainname

  This subcommand updates the current hostname (and the /etc/nodename
  file) or, with -d, the current domainname.

set-timezone timezone

  This subcommand updates the current timezone and, if appropriate,
  notifies running processes that it's changed.

create-zone [args]

  This subcommand simplifies the creation of non-global zones. Run
  'zap help create-zone' for more details.

destroy-zone -z zone_name

  This subcommand destroys the given zone.

list-zones

  This subcommand shows a list of zones present on the system.

describe-zone -z zone_name

  This subcommand shows the configuration details of the given zone.

remove-cd -z zone_name [-r]

  This subcommand detaches the CD from the given bhyve zone, so that
  when it next boots it will boot from the zone's virtual hard drive
  rather than the CD. With -r, reboot the zone immediately.

create-zone-template [args]

  This subcommand allows the construction of an alternate file-system
  that can be used to provide the basis for an alternative sparse-root
  zone. Run 'zap help create-zone-template' for more details.

list-zone-templates

  This subcommand list the known zone templates, their file system
  roots, and zones using the template.

destroy-zone-template [-n] -T template_name

  This subcommand destroys a zone template and the file system backing
  it. The action will fail if any zones are using the template.

create-user
delete-user

  These subcommands allow you to manage local user accounts. Run
  'zap help create-user' for details.

add-locale name [name...]

  This subcommand allows you to add locales. Run 'zap help add-locale'
  for details.

remove-locale name [name...]

  This subcommand allows you to remove locales. Run 'zap help remove-locale'
  for details.

list-locales

  This subcommand allows you to see what locales are available. Run
  'zap help list-locales' for details.

installed-locales

  This subcommand allows you to see what locales are installed. Run
  'zap help installed-locales' for details.

staticnet [-y]

  This subcommand converts the network configuration from a dynamic
  configuration using nwam to a fixed static configuration.

unconfigure [-a|-b|-j|-z]

  This subcommand will wipe, as far as possible, all configuration and
  history from the system - the resulting image will be blank and ready
  for usage anew. With -z, delete all non-global zones; with -b, clean
  old boot environments; with -j, remove the jack user; with -a, wipe
  everything possible. (For those with ancient Solaris muscle memory,
  usage as 'sys-unconfig' is an alias for 'unconfigure'.)
