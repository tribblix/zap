ZAP and user accounts
=====================

The zap utility allows you to create and delete users on your system.

The syntax is

  zap create-user [flags] username

or

  zap delete-user username

The valid flags for create-user, all of which are optional, are:

-c comment

A textual description of this account, often the user's full name.

-d homedir

The new user's home directory. If not given, /export/home/username
will be used.

-g gid

You can specify the name or id of an existing group that you wish to
use as this user's primary group. If not given, a new group with the
same id and name as the new user will be created and used.

-u uid

You can specify the numeric id for the new user. If not given, a free
id will be allocated.

-s shell

You can specify the shell for the new user. If not given,
/usr/bin/bash will be used.

-M mode

Set the permissions on the newly created user's home directory. By
default this will be set to 0700, restricting access to just the user
themselves, but you can use this option to be more open. The mode must
be one of the known values: 0755, 0750, 0700, 0751, 0711, or 0710.

-P "profile"

You can specify an execution profile to be allocated to the new
user. For example, "Primary Administrator". Note that as profiles
contain spaces, they need to be quoted.
