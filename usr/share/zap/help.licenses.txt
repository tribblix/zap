ZAP and software licenses
=========================

Most software is distributed under some form of license. For an open
source distribution like Tribblix, this will usually be some form of
open source license.

To display the license(s) associated with a given software package,
the syntax is

  zap show-licenses package-name

In many cases, no license files corresponding to the software are
installed, in which case you may be given a pointer to the project's
web site.
