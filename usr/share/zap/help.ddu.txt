Finding the right driver
========================

The live environment has the most common drivers installed, but there
may be additional drivers available that could be installed to make
use of additional devices.

To show the current state, mapping devices to drivers and the packages
that contain them, run the command:

zap ddu [-u] [-i]

With the -u flag, only the drivers that are not currently installed
are shown.

With the -i flag, the command to install the missing drivers is shown.

Note that this utility does not (yet) list devices for which there are
no drivers available, it will only show devices that we have a driver
for but where the driver is not yet installed.
