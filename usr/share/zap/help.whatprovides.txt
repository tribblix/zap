What package do I need for a given file?
========================================

If you know the name of the file or utility you want, the whatprovides
subcommand allows you to search for a given pathname, to find which
package you need to install.

The basic syntax is:

zap whatprovides [-p] search-term

If the -p flag is used, the search will be for the given absolute
pathname.

If the search term is a simple word, the search will be for that as a
file.

If the search term looks like a library (starts with "lib") then the
search is for the allowed forms of a shared library name.
