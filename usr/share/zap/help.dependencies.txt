Checking package dependencies
=============================

Unlike other package systems, Tribblix uses overlays to manage
collections of software, rather than attempting to use dependencies
declared by packages.

It is sometimes useful to be able to query and show dependencies, so
the command

    zap dependencies pkg_name

will list the packages that the given package depends on. With the -c
(check) flag, only dependencies that are missing will be listed:

    zap dependencies -c pkg_name

For compatibility with the latest release of Solaris 10, using pkgdep
as the subcommand name is also accepted.
