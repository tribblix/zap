Managing audio devices
======================

An illumos system may detect multiple audio devices, but not all will
be properly connected or work. The system may choose a default device
that isn't the working one, and it may therefore be necessary to
change the system's idea of which is the correct device to use.

To list the various audio devices in your system:

    zap audio list

To test the various audio devices to see which (if any) are working:

    zap audio test

This will try and play a known sound (a train whistle) using all the
known audio devices. If you can hear the sound, you should be able to 
work out which device was being used. Then (as root):

    zap audio set-default 1

can be used to change the default audio device from the initial 0.

To see what the current device is:

    zap audio show-default

If you can't hear any sound at all, check with

    zap ddu

that all relevant device drivers have been installed.
