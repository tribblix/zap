Managing additional package and overlay repositories
====================================================

The packages and overlays from which Tribblix is built come from
online repositories.

It's possible to add extra repositories. You'll need to get the
details of those repositories from the relevant supplier.

To add a package repository called myrepo, hosted at
https://example.com/myrepo, the command would be:

zap add-package-repo myrepo \
  -d "My packages" \
  -u https://example.com/myrepo/ \
  -p 1100

To add an overlay repository called myoverlays, hosted at
https://example.com/myoverlays, the command would be:

zap add-overlay-repo myoverlays \
  -d "My overlays" \
  -u https://example.com/myoverlays/ \
  -p 1100

The -d flag gives a descriptive name. The -u flag gives the URL of the
repository. The -p flag gives a numeric priority, which must be
greater than 1000. The priority is only used if you have multiple
repositories.

To remove a repository that you've added, the commands would be

zap remove-package-repo myrepo

and

zap remove-overlay-repo myoverlays

respectively.

The system repositories cannot be removed or modified, and will always
take preference over user provided repositories.
