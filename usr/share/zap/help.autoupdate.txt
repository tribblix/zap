Automatic Updates
=================

Keeping your system up to date is important to reduce problems
associated with old software that might have bugs or security issues.

This can be done manually, by running the following command regularly:

    zap update-everything

The above can also be automated. To enable automatic updates, simply

    zap autoupdate -e

To disable automatic updates, simply run

    zap autoupdate -d

To show the current status

    zap autoupdate -s

By default, automatic updates will be scheduled to run every day, at
the same time the command is run (as this is a time the system is
known to be up). To only run updates once a week, add the -w flag

    zap autoupdate -e -w

To specify a time, such as 23:15, use the -t flag

    zap autoupdate -e -t 23:15

Note that the autoupdate process and system reboots and shutdowns
aren't aware of each other, so automatic updates should be enabled
with care and a suitable time chosen.
