Router in the global zone
=========================

The best way to construct a virtual datacenter in a box - an isolated
virtual network to which zones can be connected - is to create a
router zone with the -R flag to zap create-zone.

In some  cases, this isn't possible, as it requires an additional
external IP address. For example, on many cloud instances you are
allocated a single externally-facing IP address.

The zap global-router subcommand exists to address this issue. The
syntax is, as an example

zap global-router -R 10.1.2.0/24

which creates a /24 subnet in the 10.1.2.0 range. Clearly, the address
range chosen should not conflict or overlap with any other range you
happen to be using in your infrastructure.

This will set up the appropriate network infrastructure and enable NAT
for any zones connected to that network. (Creating a zone with an IP
address in the given range will automatically connect the zone to the
internal private network.)

A precondition for the global-router to work is that the system
network interface must be statically configured, rather than the
default nwam. The zap staticnet subcommand can be used to enable this.
